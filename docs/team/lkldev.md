### Project: TAssist

**TAssist** is a desktop app for Teaching Assistants to manage their students across different modules and keep track of studentsâ€™ activities/participation in class. It is optimized for use via Command Line Interface (CLI). The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI (Graphical User Interface) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 11 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=lkldev)

* **New Feature**: Create model and storage classes for Modules
* **New Feature**: Create model and storage classes for TAssist
* **New Feature**: Create Parsers for enrol/disenrol, grade, list commands
* **New Feature**: Create model and add/delete/list commands for Assessment
* **New Feature**: Added Grade command
  * What it does: Allows TA to grade a student for their students for each of the assessment in the module.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as now the TA will be able to keep track of which student has submitted the assessments. They can use this command to easily grade the student's participation in class as well.
  * Highlights: To allow the TA to easily keep track of student participation, this command is created to increment the grade if no grade is provided so that the TA do not need to specify a grade for marking participation, they simply have to issue the command without a grade argument.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Update common classes (Model, Logic, ModelManager, LogicManager) to be compatible with TAssist.
  * Update Storage class to allow storing of TAssist data.
  * Improve storage in V1.3 to reduce storing of duplicated data.
  * Fix miscellaneous bugs before PE-D. [\#156](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/156), [\#158](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/158), [\#163](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/163), [\#164](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/164)

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for project description and quick start. [\#4](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/4)
    * Fix miscellaneous errors in User Guide (e.g. making parameters optional, wrong parameters, etc)
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added use cases for modules
    * Added Grade command implementation
